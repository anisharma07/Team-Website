Transparent and Immutable nature of blockchain is leveraged to build a fully secure and robust system. It allows authorized users to add, delete and update certificates using their public key which denies the probability of any kind of fraud from the issuer’s side while allowing users to generate and scan qr codes and receive instant verification feedback.",

Buyers can request access to listed properties, with sellers having the option to accept or deny based on buyer profiles. Transactions, including transfer requests and approvals, are recorded on the blockchain for transparency and traceability. Upon approval, the land inspector verifies documents and schedules ownership transfer meetings. Meeting records are stored on the blockchain to resolve potential disputes. After verification, the transfer is initiated, and buyers and sellers sign ownership transfer documents on the platform, recorded on the blockchain for authentication. Smart contracts facilitate fund transfers and title ownership changes. In case of disputes, authorized parties can upload signed documents to validate authenticity using blockchain-generated hashes, ensuring document integrity.",

      "Pneumonia is a respiratory infection caused by bacteria or viruses it affects many individuals, especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, where high levels of pollution, unhygienic living conditions, and overcrowding are relatively common, together with inadequate medical infrastructure. Pneumonia causes pleural effusion, a condition in which fluids fill the lung, causing respiratory difficulty. Early diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial to ensure curative treatment and increase survival rates. Chest X-ray imaging is the most frequently used method for diagnosing pneumonia. However, the examination of chest X-rays is a challenging task and is prone to subjective variability. In this study, we will develop a computer-aided diagnosis system for automatic pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images",

  //     "Music generation using deep learning techniques has garnered significant interest over the past two decades. Unlike images, music presents unique challenges across three key dimensions. Firstly, its temporal nature entails a hierarchical structure with dependencies over time. Secondly, music comprises multiple interdependent instruments that unfold over time. Thirdly, it encompasses chords, arpeggios, and melodies, resulting in multiple outputs at each time step. Despite these complexities, audio data shares similarities with conventional deep learning domains such as computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). The sequential aspect of music aligns with NLP, where Recurrent Neural Networks can be applied. Moreover, the presence of multiple audio channels resembles image data, allowing for the utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks. Furthermore, the emergence of deep generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and language models in NLP, offers exciting avenues for creating realistic synthetic data, promising advancements in music generation research.",
